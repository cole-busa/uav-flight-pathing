# UAV Flight Pathing

This project aims to find the optimal pathing for drones to find a given target. We will first determine whether it is better to have more drones than one. From this point on we will use four drones as the base case.
To determine if an algorithm is more optimal than another we will examine how many moves it takes on average to reach the goal.
